  genericfocusnews.1.d:0 "In light of the recent fracture of the United States of America, the New California Republic has pledged to protect any remnants of democracy. Remaining stoic in the face of rapidly changing ideological beliefs, NCR President Frank Merriam delivered an address in Sacramento, vowing to stifle any communist elements within the government. Additionally, to "protect the ideals of democracy as enshrined by our forefathers", President Merriam has ordered large-scale military exercises along the borders of California. Several sources within the Californian Armed Forces has claimed that this will act as a deterrent to any radical nations wishing to spread their virulent ideologies in California. Their neighbors, however, have reacted with concern, and it seems that these exercises could lead to an arms race."

  genericfocusnews.2.t:0 "The State of the Union Address"
  genericfocusnews.2.d:0 "In an address broadcast across the United States, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt gave his State of the Union address to a mostly empty House of Representatives. In the speech, he promised amnesty to any state that wished to rejoin the union, and urged the former United States to keep the peace. While the speech was scheduled to be delivered today, many observers doubted that the President would be able to deliver the speech after the Great Collapse. It's unclear what implications this will have for the future."

  genericfocusnews.3.d:0 "Early this morning, a group of organized paramilitary members stormed the White House. In what is being called "The Battle of Pennsylvania Avenue", Secret Service and Capitol Police engaged in a firefight with the group. Noticeably absent was the U.S. Army, which drew both criticism and suspicion from many onlookers. The fate of President Roosevelt has not been confirmed, with some reporting that he managed to escape through the Presidential Escape tunnels, and others claiming that he is in the custody of paramilitary elements. Some observers are calling this a coup d'etat, though it remains unclear who will now lead the fractured government."

  genericfocusnews.4.d:0 "Late yesterday, armed members of the Communist Party of D.C. stormed the steps of Capitol Hill, in an effort to capture the building. Though the effort is largely symbolic, as the building is mostly empty, leaders from the local and national goverment have come out in support of the insurgents. In a speech following the occupation, William Z. Foster, leader of the D.C. chapter of the Communist Party USA, said "This is only the first step towards recognition. No longer will our freedoms be curtailed because of our political beliefs. Workers of D.C., unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains!". Thousands have taken to the streets in an effort to force the resignation of President Roosevelt. What is certain, is that the Federal Government is reaching the breaking point."
