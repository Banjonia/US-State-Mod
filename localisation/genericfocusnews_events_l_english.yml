  genericfocusnews.1.d:0 "In light of the recent fracture of the United States of America, the New California Republic has pledged to protect any remnants of democracy. Remaining stoic in the face of rapidly changing ideological beliefs, NCR President Frank Merriam delivered an address in Sacramento, vowing to stifle any communist elements within the government. Additionally, to "protect the ideals of democracy as enshrined by our forefathers", President Merriam has ordered large-scale military exercises along the borders of California. Several sources within the Californian Armed Forces has claimed that this will act as a deterrent to any radical nations wishing to spread their virulent ideologies in California. Their neighbors, however, have reacted with concern, and it seems that these exercises could lead to an arms race."

In the speech, he promised amnesty to any state that wished to rejoin the union, and urged the former United States to keep the peace. While the speech was scheduled to be delivered today, many observers doubted that the President would be able to deliver the speech after the Great Collapse. It's unclear what implications this will have for the future."
