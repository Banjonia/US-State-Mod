While there is risk in saying no, democracy must stand strong and we may be able to reclaim our former glory as a beacon of democracy. We cannot consider our options lightly. It's our safety and reputaion on the line. Working with the fascists may be just as bad as losing our sovereignty."

#Corrupt Advisors
ohio.19.t:0 "Corrupt Officials Discovered!"

Their marionette is still unknown, but the government is doing their best to uncover the perpetrator. The only thing left to do is either keep it to ourselves and deal with them later, or uncover their corruption to the public. The former will be the easiest way, but also ill advised. There is bound to be backlash, but if we tell the public, their powers will be limited.
ohio.19.a:0 "Inform the public; their powers must be limited."
ohio.19.b:0 "We should keep this information to ourselves."

ohio.30.t:0 "Generals Defect!"
