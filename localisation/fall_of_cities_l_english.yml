news.500.t:0 "The Fall of Kansas City"
news.500.d:0 "As the sun set in [KSK.GetNameDef], the armies of Kansas were encircling Kansas City, This wouldn’t be the first time the city was a victim of violence between the two states, but it would be the last time. Tomorrow, Kansan generals would give the order to bombard the remaining Missourians within the city, and destroy the remainder of the Missourian army. The war had been an immense toll for Missouri, whose citizens would have to bury thousands of their brothers, fathers, and friends. But now, as the sun sets on the bloody ground, so too will it set on old Missouri."

news.501.d:0 "Early today, the California News Service confirmed that forces from the [CAC.GetNameDef] have captured Las Vegas. After intense fighting along the Strip, and a desperate Nevadan counter-attack from Nellis AFB, the battle has concluded in a Californian victory. Civilians report that following California's discovery of a small contingency of Nevadan forces inside the Old Mormon Fort State Park, the Californian Artillery Corps was ordered to level the fort. Additionally, some sources claim that there is a tense standoff between the nervous Arizona armies and their New Californian neighbors along Boulder Dam. Only time will tell if this situation will lead to war."

news.502.t:0 "The Fall of Los Angeles"
news.502.d:0 "Against all odds, the forces from [KSK.GetNameDef] have captured the city of Los Angeles. Despite the city having a combined population higher than the entire State of Kansas, Kansan armies managed to fight their way through the dense Los Angeles streets and towards the heart of the City of Angels.\n Intense fighting erupted in downtown Los Angeles, and after discovering that a particularly accurate sniper was holed up within the Eastern Columbia Building, known by some as the “Jewel of the West”, Kansan High Command gave the order to level it.\n Unconfirmed reports have also surfaced that the Hollywood sign was severely damaged in a dive-bombing attack."

news.503.t:0 "The Fall of Sacramento"
news.503.d:0 "Press Corps observers covering the war in California have informed us that Sacramento has fallen to the [KSK.GetNameDef]. Anticipating Sacramento's fall and wanting it to remain intact, Californian officials designated the capital an open city hours before enemy forces arrived. Though not the largest city in California, its fall will deal a significant blow to Californian morale.\n Additionally, due to its proximity to the much larger San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento will undoubtedly become a staging area for a campaign in Northern California and a possible assault on San Francisco."
news.503.a:0 "The first of our many victories to come!"
news.503.b:0 "Troubling, but our nation will recover!"
news.503.c:0 "They're lucky their Capital is so small."
news.504.t:0 "The Fall of San Francisco"
news.504.d:0 "Reports are now funneling in that [KSK.GetNameDef] has captured San Francisco. Californian forces, though initially holding Kansan forces back along bridge chokepoints, quickly became disorganized and retreated deeper into the city.\n In a desperate and arguably foolish decision, California ordered that inmates from Alcatraz be armed and organized into a penal battalion to repel the Kansan invaders. Some inmates were able to perform commendably, but others quickly used their new weapons to rebel and escape Californian custody.\n Thankfully, the [KSK.GetNameDef] ordered that the Golden Gate Bridge be kept intact."
news.504.a:0 "San Francisco is ours! I believe a parade is in order!"
news.504.b:0 "At least the Golden Gate still stands..."
news.504.c:0 "They released WHAT?"
