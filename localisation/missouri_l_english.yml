 MOM_thefuture:0 "The Future of Missouri"
 MOM_thefuture_desc:0 "Missourians see before them a new opportunity to set forth their destiny. The people in the state call for measures seen like in Germany, Socialist Radicals call for revolution in St.Louis and Kansas City, and yet more call for liberalization and a continuation on the path we have been on."
 MOM_gerbund:0 "Rise of the German Missourian Bund"
 MOM_gerbund_desc:0 "The German Missourian Bund is a popular enough organization which holds its support primarily from the Germanic communities in the country. The party primarily focuses on german cooperation and support. Without the support of the Germans, their grip on the country is much weaker."
 MOM_GMB_secures_hold:0 "The German Missourian Bund Secures Their Hold"
 MOM_GMB_secures_hold_desc:0 "Due to small numbers and unpopularity of socialists, and Tom Pendergast taking needed resources away for him and his cronies, the Bund is the only major organization providing relief for those that need it.

Even with our nationalist socialist ideals, we cannot betray the people's trust by forcing a potentially dangerous march on Jefferson. The people trust us to bring Missouri out of it's instability and weakness and bring them to the forefront of the Americas."
 MOM_increase_instability:0 "Increase Instability"
 MOM_increase_instability_desc:0 "To make a peaceful takeover of government, the government needs to be weakened. We must try our best to create instability subversively. If the public lacks information, this will be all the easier. We must take precaution in making sure that this stays away from the press and the public eye."
 MOM_fascist_pamphlets:0 "Distribute Fascist Pamphlets"

missouri.1.d:0 "Earlier today, border conflicts along the Kansas-Missouri border culminated in an all out skirmish between the two states. After intense fighting in Kansas City, the Missouri national guard was victorious!

missouri.3.a:0 "We must follow the will of the people."
