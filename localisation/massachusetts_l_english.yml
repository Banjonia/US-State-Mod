  mam.1.d:0 "The Boston meeting, proposed by Governor Curley and several mayors, will be held to discuss the future of Massachusetts. The leaders of the Anti-Revisionist Front and the New Boston Parties are willing to cooperate, but Curley's cabinet has proposed something more drastic. Charles F. Hurley and Leverett Saltonstall, both the leaders of their respective organizations would be assassinated on their way to the capitol building. We've arranged for the police to look the other way, and our sniper is in position. What is our next step?"
