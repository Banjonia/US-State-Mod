CAC_politicalstate_desc:0 "The 1936 Election has been heated so far, with the 3 main leaders being Frank Merriam, a Republican who supports making the Pacific States of America and uniting Oregon and Washington State. Upton Sinclair, a communist who had some populist movements in recent weeks, but still failing with few votes. James E. Davis, a LA Police officer who is popular with the Conservative voters. Who will lead our nation?"

CAC_frankmerriamsplans_desc:0 "If we are to survive the coming storm, we must trust in our leadership. Governor Merriam has proven time and time again that he is a capable leader with a pragmatic approach to governing. Though many around us have abandoned democracy, the New California Republic will continue to be a shining example of what democracy can offer the world."

CAC_uptonsinclairsplan_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Longshoreman's strike and Merriam's crackdown on unions, one thing has become clear- The workers of California are under attack, and the only thing that will save it is a political revolution. Merriam stands for the evils of capitalism, and Davis is a corrupt fascist. As Sinclair once wrote, "one of the necessary accompaniments of capitalism in a democracy is political corruption.""
