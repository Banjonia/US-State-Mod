 tex.5.t:0 "The Capitol Building Under the Control of Nationalists!"
 tex.5.d:0 " \n A few hours ago, the Capitol Building in Austin was taken over by some nationalists that have begun to fight for their cause. The army was swayed beneath our noses and now we must pay the price. Only time will tell what these nationalist want, but it doesn't look good. We fear what will happen to Texas if the nationalists take charge, but only time will tell. A government should not be so unnaware of what's happening beneath them, but hindsight is 20/20. We can only hope that Texas does not lose it's way."
 tex.5.a:0 "A glorious day for our cause!"

#Focuses
 TXT_texaswillagainraiseitshead:0 "Texas Will Again Raise It's Head"
 TXT_texaswillagainraiseitshead_desc:0 "Texas will again lift its head and stand among the nations. It ought to do so, for no country upon the globe can compare with it in natural advantages. -Sam Houston"
 TXT_lonestar:0 "Lone Star State"
 TXT_lonestar_desc:0 "Texas was once a nation that stood soverign in between giants. With those giants gone, we can take a new direction. With those giants gone, we have become one. Without the giants, we can rule."
 TXT_subversive_takeover:0 "Subversive Takeover"
 TXT_subversive_takeover_desc:0 "While the german sector of our ideology prides themselves on military might, we do not think like barbarians. We know the value of subversive activities and the wonders it can do for us. If we take our time with our governmental takeover, we can avoid countless months worth of reconstruction."
 TXT_promote_riots:0 "Encourage Riots"
 TXT_promote_riots_desc:0 "If the public is on our side, we are strong. Without the public we are nothing. If we can encourage people to riot in the large cities, lots of money will be spent on repression. Riots will also be a show of unwaivering loyalty to our cause, securing our hold and making our support look larger than it is."
 TXT_radio_broadcasts:0 "Begin Radio Broadcasts"
 TXT_radio_broadcasts_desc:0 "To increase the support of the public, we can start to broadcast radio programs. The radio is a powerful tool, and it could be the difference between the life or death of this cause. The radio is crucial to getting our cause out there and being seen by the public, which will hopefully increase our support."
 TXT_gain_support_of_generals:0 "Support from High Command"
 TXT_gain_support_of_generals_desc:0 "The generals in the country hold the power. With the support of the generals, a revolt would be strongly in our favor. The generals might be hard to sway, but with enough coaxing they may switch their allegiance. After all, they support the will of the people."
 TXT_gain_support_of_the_army:0 "Gain Support of the Army"
 TXT_gain_support_of_the_army_desc:0 "Without the support of the army, the generals will be of no use. We need the army to be in our favor to get a peaceful takeover. We can promise more military spending once in power, but we may not hold true to our word. That would not be a great idea, but we'll do what we have to."
 TXT_storm_the_capitol:0 "Storm the Capitol Building"
 TXT_storm_the_capitol_desc:0 "With support from all ground forces, we can now storm the Capitol Building in Austin. Those who opposed the new regime were quick to walk out after seeing how outnumbered they were. They will be missed in the army, but if there is a need, they will be forced back into the military. The Capitol Building will be ours, and the government will fall into a new light."
 TXT_rebuild_the_capitol:0 "Rebuild the Capitol"
 TXT_rebuild_the_capitol_desc:0 "While the march on the Capitol Building was a success, there were damages on the building and its surrounding areas. We did achieve our goal, though. If the march on the capital was a projection of our future sucess, then we will prosper. Civil war was avoided and it's better to repair just the capital and surrounding areas than to rebuild a whole nation."
 TXT_weaker_neighbors:0 "Subjugate the Weaker Neighbors"
 TXT_weaker_neighbors_desc:0 "While there are some ex-united states in North America that would be strong allies, the potential with them is limited. It would be a smarter idea to subjugate our smaller neighbors. While weak now, their potential is much higher in the hands of a capable government. Their governments will still exist, but they will merely be puppets to ours."
 TXT_diplomacy:0 "Texan Diplomacy"
 TXT_diplomacy_desc:0 "With our less radical government, we can promote Texan Diplomacy. We will reach out to all of our neighbors and attempt to make positive relations with them. If we succeed, we will have less of an annoyance when carrying out our plans. Even if our relations eventually sour, we now will have more time and more leverage for when we do begin to achieve our goals."
 TXT_influence:0 "Influence Foreign Governments"
 TXT_influence:0 "While the governments in America are steel reeling from the Great Collapse, we can try to sway them. Many countries in old United States have not set up a strong government yet, leaving exploitable areas within. We can try to send spies within their governments to try and convince officials of other political standings. Democracy has failed us, and we should treat it as such."
 TXT_naxis:0 "North American Axis"
 TXT_naxis_desc:0 "In North America, there has yet to be a strong country to lead others into the future. The failure of democracy and the rise of fascism in our country has left us to do the job. With seemingly nobody else to fill the power void in the South, we must step in and lead others to a future that we control. They will think the power is shared, but we know otherwise."
 TXT_into_the_chihuahuan:0 "Venture Through the Chihuahuan Desert"
 TXT_into_the_chihuahuan_desc:0 "To expand our influence in North America we will have to make some ventures. Some of the ventures will be uncomfortable for our troops, but we'll become acclimated to the terrain in no time. To secure our hold and compete with the great powers of America, we must make uncomfortable decisions."
 TXT_arms_in_new_mexico:0 "Military Industry in New Mexico"
 TXT_arms_in_new_mexico_desc:0 "Arizona and California are very real threats and after their military defeat, New Mexico must get stronger. Now that they're under our control and firmly under our grasp, we can safely encourage that strength, if not directly influence it. We should be able to spare some help for them."
 TXT_amentities_in_new_mexico:0 "Civilian Industry in New Mexico"
 TXT_amentities_in_new_mexico_desc:0 "While the instructions were very clear on to avoid damaging civilian industry when moving through New Mexico was very clear, things did not go as planned. Civilian industry was still damaged, and it requires repair. Sometimes these things do not go as planned, but we just have to deal with them as they arise."
 TXT_santa_fe_austin_railway:0 "Austin-Santa Fe Railway"
 TXT_santa_fe_austin_railway:0 "In the event of an Arizonan or Californian attack on New Mexico, we must be able to act quickly. A railway from Austin to Santa Fe will greatly increase our mobilization speed and allow us to move supplies much faster. It will also encourage industry in the areas that were less accessable before the railway."
 TXT_to_tulsa:0 "A March to Tulsa"
 TXT_to_tulsa_desc:0 "To secure our northern border from the ever-increasing aggression from Kansas, we must take preemptive action. The safest way to do this is to deprive Kansas of the Red River, an important strategic barrier between our nations. With their underside exposed, we will be able to march across their vast plains and into their capital or set up border defenses that will be inpenetrable by Kansan forces."
 TXT_arms_in_oklahoma:0 "Oklahoman Arms Investments"
 TXT_arms_in_oklahoma_desc:0 "While we could single-handedly defend against the Kansans if war were to break out, we could always do with a little more help. If we invest in the arms industry in Oklahoma, we could make more preparations. They could be a defensive force so we could be purely offensive. The arms industry in Oklahoma is needed to create a safe barrier between us and the Kansans."
 TXT_amentities_in_oklahoma:0 "Aid to the North"
 TXT_amentities_in_oklahoma_desc:0 "While the arms industry is important in Oklahoma, we are keeping them afloat. We must first need to construct civilian industry so that they can keep their own economy going. With the strain relieved, we could focus more on the military or increase our own civilian industry more. To create a viable state, the Oklahoman civilian industry is invaluable to creating strong puppet governments, making us stronger along the way."
 TXT_OK_city_austin:0 "Sooner Railways"
 TXT_OK_city_austin_desc:0 "To properly mobilize our troops, we need an effective form of transport throughout our lands and our puppet's land. A railway from Austin to Oklahoma City is a stepping stone for that strong infrastructure. A railway is the minimum we can use to get our troops and supplies across the South effectively."
 TXT_to_baton_rouge:0 "March on Baton Rouge"
 TXT_to_baton_rouge_desc:0 "For years we've been antagonized by the Louisianans. With the protection of the United States gone, the Louisianans will not have the last laugh. We will make a charge across the Sabine river and stride across the marshland. We will march on Baton Rouge and show the Louisianans that without protection, they are able to be crushed and they will be."
 TXT_arms_in_louisiana:0 "Develop Cajun Arms Industry"
 TXT_arms_in_louisiana:0 "While the Louisianans did get taken over and occupied, the still hold a strong resentment towards us. Promoting a strong arms industry might prove problematic in the future, but we could handle that when the time comes. Now, we need to focus heavily on promoting a strong arms industry that will provide us with guns that will support us in times of war and create more for us to use in training."
 TXT_amentities_in_louisiana:0 "Aid to the East"
 TXT_amentities_in_louisiana_desc:0 "While the Louisianan people have a very strong distain for us, that doesn't mean they can't have basic human items. Unlike our radical counterparts, we do not support oppression and genocide. Our people's do not get along well, but in essence, we're all southerners, and we must stick together."
 TXT_baton_rouge_to_austin:0 "The Cajun Express"
 TXT_baton_rouge_to_austin_desc:0 "The terrain in Louisiana is some of the most hazardous in the country. Naturally this means that without proper infrastructure, our military will be functionally unable to perform their duties. A joint infrastructure modernization campaign with Louisiana will surely serve both of our interests."
