 WOTW_TITLE:0 "Welcome to §GWar of the Worlds§!!"
 WEL_INTRO:0 "            Regarding this world with envious eyes, minds immersible to our own, the creatures that slithe and writher on the red planet have launched an invasion of Earth! Using the real world 1938 radio broadcast as inspiration, War of the Worlds for Hearts of Iron 4 pits humanity against the Martian menace at one of its most turbulent times in history. Landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey, the Martians are pose to take the heartland of the United States in just a few months, the American army having not been prepared for conventional warfare let alone the mighty Fighting Machines of Mars. Unable to stop there, the Martian commander is already drawing up plans for the 'other' super power across the channel, more hydrogen launchers being moved into position to target a small patch of land called Horsell Common."
 WEL_UPDATE_INFO:0 "            Bits and pieces from all War of the Worlds lore can be found throughout the mod, from the original novel, to the 1953 film, to Jeff Wayne's Musical, and many more. Beyond that references from numerous other science fiction universes can be found strategically spread throughout. Updates will come as the base game is overhauled or new features are added, however once the final models and subsequent update is complete the mod will be considered 99% done."

 WOTW_HINT_MAR_TITLE:0 "§RMartian§! Strategy"
 WEL_INTRO_TO_MAR:0 "            The gravity of our situation is extreme commander. Deserts having all but engulfed the ancient monuments, our homeworld is now incapable of sustaining life. Efforts to maintain the biosphere are exhausted, every year more water is lost to the vacuum of space. If our population is to survive, the only consequential course of action is the conquest and occupation of Earth. You have been chosen to fulfill this task. A pair suspension pods have been sent to the heartland of this world's rising power to assist you. From there you will grow your industry and influence readying for our colonization, exterminating the human filth as necessary. The future of Mars is in your hands, commander."
 WEL_HOW_TO_MAR1:0 "            The Martians play very differently from other nations. Numbers will not be on your side, you must use your technological advantage while you can to defeat humanity before their scientists outpace your research. You do have the advantage of starting with two doctrine trees, and numerous passive bonuses. Early game the goal will be to take New York as fast as possible, in order for the first extermination event to fire and unlock the political focuses. From there taking out the US is your prime objective, England is the easiest second target and Germany should be saved for after you land troops in France. The Soviets will be extremly difficult to defeat if you do not unlock Supply the Invasion, or finish off Germany. If the US forms the GDI, you will have to watch out for their special XCOM divisions. Should they spawn a focus will unlock which gives Mars a single chance to take them out, otherwise every nation with the tech can near-endlessly spawn new reinforcements."
 WEL_HOW_TO_MAR2:0 "            At the beginning of the game, Mars has a slight leaning toward what the humans call ‘communism’. If you so choose to go down the Support Radical side of your tree, it will allow you a more humane policy toward Earth, forming a seperate puppet which all non-cores are transfered to as the invasion progresses. This path however locks the United Federation from spawning once Final Measures finishes. There is a chance the colony will switch to the Federation, but it is small."
 WEL_HOW_TO_MAR3:0 "            The Martian homeworld is void of liquid water, what small amounts remain trapped under the surface or frozen at the poles. As such they lack the technical understanding of seafaring vessels, their industry geared more toward their tripods and air-space fleet. Focusing on a navy will unlock many free technologies, and allow the invasion to move away from suspension pods and over to naval landings. However, Mars will never have the bonuses for ocean technology that they do elsewhere. If you still wish to go down this tree, focus on getting the Naval Conversion focus first. The navy that spawns as a result although mediocre compared to the naval powers of Earth, is a good jumping off point. In any case, make sure to always have your core territory garrisoned, as the humans will constantly try for invasions themselves, and should the Federation form keep detachments on your islands else they steal them via decisions."
 
 WOTW_HINT_USA_TITLE:0 "§MAmerican§! Strategy"
 WEL_INTRO_TO_USA:0 "            The reports are flooding in, Mr. President, that Welles fellow wasn’t exaggerating on the radio when he described those ‘tripods’. It seems they’ve already set up a headquarters in the capsule, and have begun eliminating nearby towns. There’s still no word from the New Jersey national guard, we have to assume they’re dead. I’m not sure how to tell you this sir, but the situation looks bleak. Nothing we throw at them seems to make a large enough dent to do anything more than slow their progress. We’ve had a few telegrams from London offering support. Maybe we should take them up on the offer, a global coalition sure beats having to try and make sense of their tech ourselves. What are your orders, Mr. President?"
 WEL_HOW_TO_USA1:0 "            The United States possibly has both the worst and best position at the start of the invasion. Being the first target of Mars, you will have the greatest technological disparity of the entire run, however if you are able to contain the invaders, you will have first pick of some very good focuses and events. Once the war begins, do not try to defend New England and its surrounding territory. Leave some troops there to stall and form a defensive barrier near Washington until you complete the Defence of Earth focus. From there immediately fall back to the Mississippi, and once conditions are met begin construction of the Macarthur Line. Tripods count as armor, so prioritize anti-tank research and defensive doctrines. No matter what, do not let Georgia fall! With it the Martians with have the cure for their disease which will eventually ravage them."
 WEL_HOW_TO_USA2:0 "           Joining the Allies right from the get go may seem tempting, but it is far better to wait for the Defense of Earth focus. With it you will get the option to either join the Allies via event, or create your own faction. Creating your own faction although not seeming like the best opportunity at the time given England doesn’t immediately join, it is the best for the long term. After that point as all of the majors are attacked, they are given the option to join your faction even if they were already in one, bringing in all their allies with them. The Global Defense Infinitive is also required for the creation of XCOM."
 WEL_HOW_TO_USA3:0 "           XCOM, or Extraterrestrial Combat Unit, is by far the most powerful division type in the game. In order to get the technology, from the 1936 start date, you need to accept every X-Files event as ‘truth’ later forming Unit-X as a result. From there Germany must have created their Vril Society, and you must have formed the GDI. If you are at peace with Germany, the decision to form them should be visible. They are extremly costly to build, incentivising you to only gain divisions via decisions and events."
 
 WOTW_HINT_GENERIC_TITLE:0 "Surviving the Invasion"
 WEL_INTRO_TO_OTHER:0 "           Sir, you need to listen to this, its broadcasting all over the country. \"...program to bring you a special bulletin from the Intercontinental Radio News. At approximately 12:00, greenwich meantime, what eye witnesses have described as massive metal ‘tripods’ attacked the [USA.GetName] of America. This invasion appears to be related to the strange activity reported on Mars yesterday. American forces are attempting to hold back these machines, however there is no word if...\" We must act now before the people are drummed up into a panic. Surely these invaders will leave us alone, but in the event they don't. I have a line connected to our forces sir."
 WEL_HOW_TO_OTHER1:0 "           Attempting to survive the invasion as a minor or non-american major isn't as simple as avoiding allying to the Martian's main targets. With their Suspension Pod button, it is possible to attack any country on the map. The only way to avoid this is to make sure to build at least one level of anti-air in every state. From there, trying to build up your forces to outnumber the Martians is a good general strategy, as is prioritizing anti-tank research and defensive doctrines. If you join the Axis for one reason or another, and Poland is attacked as normal, there is a chance for an event to pop up causing a white peace with minor territory concessions to Germany and it’s allies, so do not overcommit your forces in such a war. If the Martians finish their Fallen Earth focus, it will lead to a game over. As such, if they are about to win the final invasion against either the United Federation or the last faction, make sure to declare your own war if you have not already to delay that focus. Finally, XCOM is your friend, if you know you are about to be invaded and the US has formed their GDI faction, join it before XCOM is created to get the tech."
 WEL_HOW_TO_OTHER2:0 "           [ENG.GetNameDefCap] should technically be considered a main target alongside America, however as they are not attacked right away and do not have as much flavor they are instead relegated to a secondary invasion target. Still, next to the US they have the most events of the human nations. When London falls, there is a chance for a certain lone battleship to save a group of fleeing transports, either surviving or dying in the process. If it survives, do not let it be sunk through normal gameplay, the United Federation has events referencing it. In all likelihood, if London does fall the rest of the island will soon follow. Upon that happening, the royalty will attempt to flee to one of the colonies, letting this occur will cause that nation to become a major and force the Martians to capitulate them before the war can be over. At some point, Mars will be struck with the common cold, a deadly ailment for them. The cure is located in the state of Georgia and finding it will open a decision for England to try and infect them with an even worse infection."
 
 WOTW_FED_TITLE:0 "§MUnited Federation§! and §RMartian Colonies§!"
 WEL_INTRO_TO_FED:0 "           That was an excellent speech, the cheers reached all the way down to the situation room. I don't think anyone will easily forget the date October 30th, 1938 in the near future. Although now that business is out of the way, we need to begin discussions of our strategy to beat back the Martian menace. I have several proposals here for you, the reconstruction efforts obviously should take precedent, but there are other items which are a bit more flexible. Reports indicate sections of either the American or English navies survived the initial attack, we should try to contact them. In the meantime, operatives around the world are also preparing extraction of divisions and army leaders from the fallen powers. We're just waiting on are your orders,  Mr. Prime Minister."
 WEL_HOW_TO_FED1:0 "           The United Federation can spawn if the Martians remain fascist and have completed their Final Measures focus. With historical on and a human Mars, there is a 98% chance of them spawning. With historical on and a AI Mars, there is a 70% chance of them spawning. With historical off, there is a 50-50 chance they will spawn. Once the Federation forms, they will begin annexing every nation not currently at war with the invaders, before puppeting those who are at war and declaring their own liberation of Earth. When puppeting those at war, there is a chance for the game to lag as it calculates white peace between three way human-wars, so give it time to catch up before getting worried. At the same time the liberation begins, a human Mars will get the option to switch to them, doing so is a one way street and you will not get the in-game option to switch back."
 WEL_HOW_TO_FED2:0 "           Island Hoping is one of the most important focuses for the Federation. With it, they can begin taking back islands via decisions without having to actually invade them. It's an excellent great way to get early resources assuming Mars didn't leave many nations at peace for you to annex. From there, choosing the Thunder Child focus leans your navy toward capital ships, while the American Remnant leans you toward a more carrier focused navy. Similarly, each of the army integration focuses leans your country latter down the three toward one of the main land doctrine types, with the French Legions giving you the option of superior firepower or grand battleplan. If Mars finishes their Red Weed focus, you will need to beeline down the path to remove it, otherwise the liberation will become exceedingly more difficult."
 WEL_HOW_TO_FED3:0 "           If Mars goes down their communist path, EXALT will form instead of the Federation upon completion of the Martian Colonies focus. It is technically possible that EXALT will eventually reform into the Federation by becoming democratic, but it is extremely difficult for a human let alone the AI. While communist, you will be unable to go down your political tree, though as Mars expands you will be transferred all but their ‘core’ states in New England. If Mars completes their Fallen Earth focus,  EXALT will no longer be able to take their democratic reformer, thus being locked into communism."
